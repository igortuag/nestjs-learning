**Tutorial 7: Error Handling and Logging in NestJS**

In this tutorial, we will dive into error handling and logging in your NestJS application. Effective error handling and logging are crucial for diagnosing issues, improving user experience, and maintaining a stable application. We will explore how to handle errors, create custom exceptions, and implement logging mechanisms.

### Step 1: Recap

Before proceeding, make sure you have completed the previous tutorials and have a solid understanding of creating modules, controllers, services, CRUD operations, validation, authentication, and authorization.

### Step 2: Implementing Custom Exceptions

1. Create custom exception classes that inherit from `HttpException` provided by NestJS. These classes will encapsulate different types of errors that your application can encounter.

2. Implement exception filters to catch specific exceptions and return meaningful error responses to clients.

### Step 3: Implementing Logging

1. Choose a logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino) and install the required package.

2. Create a logger service that encapsulates your chosen logging library's functionality. Implement methods for logging different levels of messages.

### Step 4: Implementing Interceptors

1. Create an interceptor that captures and logs incoming requests and outgoing responses.

2. Use the created interceptor globally or apply it to specific routes/controllers.

### Step 5: Run and Test Your Application

1. In your terminal, run the following command to start your NestJS application:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

2. Test your application by sending various requests, intentionally causing errors, and observing how the error handling and logging mechanisms work.

### Step 6: Further Exploration

- Explore more advanced logging techniques, such as log rotation, log levels, and logging to different transports (e.g., files, databases).
- Implement global exception filters to handle uncaught exceptions and provide a consistent error response format.
- Experiment with different strategies for error categorization and handling, based on the nature of your application.
