**Tutorial 4: Data Persistence with TypeORM**

In this tutorial, we will delve into data persistence using TypeORM, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that simplifies database interactions. We'll integrate TypeORM into our NestJS application, create entities, repositories, and perform database operations.

### Step 1: Recap

Before proceeding, make sure you have completed the previous tutorials and have a good understanding of creating modules, controllers, services, and CRUD operations in NestJS.

### Step 2: Install TypeORM and Database Driver

1. Install TypeORM and a database driver (e.g., PostgreSQL) using the following command:

```bash
npm install @nestjs/typeorm typeorm pg
```

2. Configure the database connection in the `app.module.ts` file by importing `TypeOrmModule` and providing the database connection configuration.

### Step 3: Create an Entity

1. Create an entity using the Nest CLI:

```bash
nest generate entity task
```

2. Inside the `task.entity.ts` file (`src/tasks/task.entity.ts`), define the fields and decorators for the entity properties.

### Step 4: Create a Repository

1. Inside the `tasks` module folder (`src/tasks/`), create a repository for the `Task` entity using the Nest CLI:

```bash
nest generate repository task
```

2. Inside the `task.repository.ts` file (`src/tasks/task.repository.ts`), extend the `Repository` class from TypeORM and add methods for database operations.

### Step 5: Using the Repository in the Service

1. Inject the `TaskRepository` into the `TasksService`:

```typescript
constructor(
  @InjectRepository(TaskRepository)
  private taskRepository: TaskRepository,
) {}
```

2. Inside the `tasks.service.ts` file (`src/tasks/tasks.service.ts`), use the repository methods to perform database operations.

### Step 6: Connecting the Entity and Repository

1. Import and use the `Task` entity in the `TaskRepository`:

```typescript
@EntityRepository(Task)
export class TaskRepository extends Repository<Task> {
  // repository methods here
}
```

2. Register the `TaskRepository` as a provider in the `tasks.module.ts` file.

### Step 7: Run and Test Your Application

1. In your terminal, run the following command to start your NestJS application:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

2. Use your API testing tools to create, read, update, and delete tasks, observing how TypeORM simplifies database interactions.

### Step 8: Further Exploration

- Explore advanced features of TypeORM, such as migrations, relationships, transactions, and custom query builders.
- Consider integrating validation and data transformation techniques discussed in previous tutorials to enhance your data persistence layer.
- Continue building on this foundation to create more complex and feature-rich applications.
