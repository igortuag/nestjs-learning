**Tutorial 6: Authentication and Authorization with Guards**

In this tutorial, we will focus on adding authentication and authorization to our NestJS application using guards. Guards are a powerful feature that allows you to protect routes and endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources.

### Step 1: Recap

Before proceeding, make sure you have completed the previous tutorials and have a solid understanding of creating modules, controllers, services, CRUD operations, and adding validation to the API.

### Step 2: Implementing Authentication

1. Choose an authentication strategy based on your application's needs. Common strategies include JWT (JSON Web Tokens), session-based authentication, and OAuth.

2. Install the required packages for your chosen authentication strategy (e.g., `@nestjs/jwt` for JWT-based authentication).

3. Create an authentication service that handles user login and token generation.

4. Implement an authentication controller that handles user login and returns an authentication token upon successful login.

### Step 3: Implementing Authorization

1. Create an authorization guard using the Nest CLI:

```bash
nest generate guard auth
```

2. Inside the `auth.guard.ts` file (`src/auth/auth.guard.ts`), implement the `canActivate` method to check if the user is authenticated and authorized to access the requested route.

### Step 4: Applying Guards

1. Apply the authentication guard to the routes or endpoints that require authentication.

```typescript
@Controller('tasks')
@UseGuards(AuthGuard())
export class TasksController {
  // controller methods here
}
```

### Step 5: Run and Test Your Application

1. In your terminal, run the following command to start your NestJS application:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

2. Use your API testing tools to send requests to protected endpoints. Observe how the authentication guard enforces authentication before granting access.

### Step 6: Further Exploration

- Explore more advanced authentication and authorization techniques, such as role-based access control and JWT claims.
- Integrate third-party authentication providers like OAuth or OpenID Connect for single sign-on capabilities.
- Consider implementing custom decorators and guards to handle specific authorization scenarios.
