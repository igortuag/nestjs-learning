# NestJS Learning Repository

Welcome to my NestJS Learning Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for documenting my learning journey and showcasing projects built with NestJS. The goal of this repository is to provide a structured roadmap for learning NestJS and to track my progress as I explore the framework's features and build real-world applications.

## Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of NestJS and its architecture
- Understand how to build scalable and maintainable server-side applications
- Gain hands-on experience by working on practical projects
- Explore advanced features of NestJS, such as microservices, GraphQL, and WebSockets
- Practice good coding practices, project structure, and code organization
- Collaborate and share knowledge with the development community

## Structure

The repository is organized into several directories to facilitate the learning process and project development. Here's an overview of the structure:

- `docs/`: This directory contains documentation related to the learning process, including notes, summaries, and resources gathered during the journey.
- `examples/`: Here, you can find code examples and snippets that illustrate various concepts and features of NestJS. These examples are organized by topic and can be used as references for specific functionalities.
- `projects/`: This directory houses the projects built during the learning process. Each project is contained in its own subdirectory and includes a separate README file with project-specific details.
- `tutorials/`: In this directory, you can find step-by-step tutorials that guide you through specific aspects of NestJS. These tutorials cover topics such as authentication, database integration, error handling, and more.
- `roadmap.md`: The roadmap file outlines the suggested learning path for mastering NestJS. It provides a structured sequence of topics and concepts to follow, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the framework.
