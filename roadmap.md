## NestJS Learning Roadmap

### 1. Getting Started with NestJS
- Learn the basics of NestJS and its architecture
- Understand the concepts of modules, controllers, and providers in NestJS
- Set up a new NestJS project
- Explore the project structure and configuration files

### 2. Controllers and Routing
- Understand the role of controllers in handling incoming requests
- Learn about routing and how to define routes in NestJS
- Implement different types of routes, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- Handle request parameters, query parameters, and request payloads
- Implement request validation and error handling

### 3. Dependency Injection and Providers
- Understand the concept of dependency injection in NestJS
- Learn about providers and how to use them to manage dependencies
- Explore different types of providers in NestJS, such as services, repositories, factories, etc.
- Implement custom providers and use them in controllers and modules

### 4. Modules and Services
- Dive deeper into modules and their role in organizing the application
- Learn how to create and import modules in NestJS
- Understand the purpose of services and how to create them
- Explore the use of decorators and metadata in services

### 5. Data Persistence and Databases
- Integrate a database into your NestJS application (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Learn how to use the TypeORM or Mongoose libraries for database operations
- Implement data models, repositories, and data access logic
- Perform CRUD operations using NestJS and your chosen database

### 6. Authentication and Authorization
- Implement user authentication using libraries like Passport or JWT
- Learn how to protect routes and resources using middleware and guards
- Implement role-based or permission-based authorization
- Explore different authentication strategies, such as JWT, OAuth, etc.

### 7. Error Handling and Logging
- Implement centralized error handling and error responses
- Learn about exception filters and how to handle exceptions globally
- Set up logging in your NestJS application
- Use middleware for request logging and error logging

### 8. Testing
- Learn different testing techniques in NestJS
- Write unit tests for your controllers, services, and other components
- Explore the use of testing frameworks like Jest
- Implement integration tests for your NestJS application

### 9. Advanced Topics
- Explore advanced topics in NestJS, such as microservices, GraphQL, WebSockets, etc.
- Learn about NestJS decorators and how to create custom decorators
- Understand NestJS middleware and create custom middleware
- Explore NestJS interceptors and create custom interceptors

### 10. Build Real-World Projects
- Apply your knowledge to build real-world projects using NestJS
- Create RESTful APIs, backend applications, or microservices
- Implement features like authentication, data validation, and data persistence
- Practice good project structure, code organization, and best practices

Remember to practice regularly, build small projects, and refer to the official NestJS documentation and examples for a deeper understanding. Good luck with your learning journey!
